# Movie Recommendation System

## 🎥 Project Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a machine learning–based application that suggests movies to users based on similarity analysis. It focuses on content-based filtering by analyzing movie features such as genres, keywords, and descriptions.

This project demonstrates the practical application of recommendation algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.
